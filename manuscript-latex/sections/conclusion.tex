\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this essay, I first introduce the critical insights and contributions \cite{Bauer2019} make to the existing literature. I then review the precise statistical model of multilayer feedforward neural network and the motivation behind this model. I also notify how this new model differs from previous models and its improvement upon others. To follow up, I attempt to replicate the Monte-Carlo simulation in the original paper. Even though my simulation is simpler, my simulation results are still reconcilable with theirs in a sense that multilayer feedforward neural networks perform extraordinarily in cases of ordinary general hierarchical interaction models with $1<d^*<d$. Furthermore, I point out two new interesting findings on basis of my simulation. Finally, I design an R Shiny App to visualize the prediction power of all models in an interactive way.
